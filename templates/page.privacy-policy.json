In other cases, Studio Selé may be the controller of some of your Personal Information (such as when we collect your billing information, or contact information for marketing purposes, or when monitoring usage information on our Site).<br\/><br\/>A “Data Processor” is an organization which processes Personal Information for a Data Controller. As a Data Processor, we may be bound by the requirements of the GDPR.<br\/><br\/>“Data processing” is any operation or set of operations (whether automated or not) performed upon Personal Information. Examples of data processing explicitly listed in the text of the GDPR are: collection, recording, organizing, structuring, storing, adapting, altering, retrieving, consulting, using, disclosing by transmission, disseminating or making available, aligning or combining, restricting, erasure or destruction.<br\/><br\/>If the processing of personal data about you is subject to European Union data protection law, you have certain rights with respect to that data:<br\/>- You can request access to, and rectification or erasure of, personal data;<br\/>- If any automated processing of personal data is based on your consent or a contract with you, you have a right to transfer or receive a copy of your personal data in a usable and portable format;<br\/>- If the processing of personal data is based on your consent, you can withdraw consent at any time for future processing;<br\/>- You can to object to, or obtain a restriction of, the processing of personal data under certain circumstances; and<br\/>- For residents of France, you can send us specific instructions regarding the use of your data after your death.<br\/><br\/>To make such requests, contact us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@unceil.com\" title=\"mailto:hello@unceil.com\">hello@unceil.com<\/a>. When we are processing data on behalf of another party that is the Data Controller, you should direct your request to that party. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, but we encourage you to first contact us with any questions or concerns. Please be aware that those rights set out above may not apply in some instances, for example where our right to processing your personal data may be necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression (e.g., news gathering), or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.<br\/><br\/>We will only use your Personal Information if we have a lawful basis for doing so. Lawful bases for processing include consent, contractual necessity, and our “legitimate interests” or the legitimate interest of others, as further described below.<br\/><br\/>- Contractual Necessity: We process the following categories of Personal Information because we need the Personal Information to perform the Service: (a) contact information; (b) user account information; (c) billing and financial account information; (d) transaction information; and (e) user content you may submit to us.<br\/>- Legitimate Interest: We process the following categories of Personal Information when we believe doing so furthers the legitimate interest of us or third parties. This may include when we operate and improve our business, products, and services; or when marketing our products and services to you; or protecting our Services from fraud or security threats; or completion of corporate transactions, and includes (a) contact information; (b) user account information; (c) billing and financial account information; (d) transaction information; and (e) user content you may submit to us; and (f) log data.<br\/>- Consent: In some cases, we process Personal Information based on the consent you expressly grant to us at the time we collect such data. When we process Personal Information based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you at the point and time of collection.<br\/>- Other Processing Grounds: From time to time we may also need to process Personal Information to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other persons, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.<br\/><br\/>We will not transfer your Personal Information outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) unless it takes such measures as are necessary to provide adequate protection for such Personal Information consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. To the extent that we process (or causes to be processed) any Personal Information originating from the EEA in a country that has not been designated by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Information, the Personal Information shall be deemed to have adequate protection (within the meaning of EU Data Protection Legislation) by virtue of the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for data transfers between EU and non-EU countries, whereby you will be regarded as the Data Exporter and we will be regarded as the Data Importer. In the event that the Contractual Clauses are deemed to no longer be a valid mechanism to legitimize transfers of personal data outside the European Economic Area, we will amend this Policy in order to establish a legitimate transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area.<br\/><br\/>Principle of Onward Transfer. In the context of an onward transfer of data to a third party, we have responsibility for the processing of Personal Data we receive and subsequently transfer to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf. We shall remain liable under applicable law if our agent processes such Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with applicable law, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.<br\/><br\/>Governed by the requirements contained in GDPR, we will provide you with a reasonable opportunity to access your Personal Information that we have collected, correct it if it is inaccurate, erase it, or to request we restrict processing of the data. You also have the right to data portability, to have us provide the data to other entities. Please see GDPR Articles 15 through 18 then 20 for the requirements and procedures necessary to exercise these rights. We do not engage in automated data processing or profiling as those terms are understood under GDPR.<br\/><br\/>With respect to these rights, (a) we reserve the right to not provide information until we receive adequate information to identify that you are the relevant data subject and to request additional information to confirm your identity; (b) with an access request or data portability request, we reserve the right to deny access to information where the rights or freedoms of other individuals may be adversely affected; (c) for requests for copies of data pursuant to an access request, we reserve the right to charge an administrative fee for any request after the first; (d) when requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, we reserve the right to charge an administrative fee or to refuse to act on the request. When the purpose for data processing is based on consent, you have the right to withdrawal consent at any time, although that does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before it is withdrawn. When the purpose for data processing is based on contract, we will likely not be able to provide you services without the Personal Information we request and so will likely have to terminate the relationship.<\/p>"
